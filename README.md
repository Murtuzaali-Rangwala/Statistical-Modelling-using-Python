# Statistical Modelling Using Python ðŸŽµðŸ“Š  

This project involves analyzing and statistically modeling music feature data collected from an online free source. The workflow demonstrates essential data cleaning, visualization, and modeling techniques using Python.  

## Libraries Used  
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis  
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations  
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization  
- **Seaborn**: Statistical data visualization  
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning and statistical modeling  

## Steps Undertaken  
1. **Checked for NULL Values**: Inspected the dataset for missing values.  
2. **Data Cleaning**: Addressed data inconsistencies and inaccuracies.  
3. **Filled NULL Values**: Replaced missing entries with `"Unknown"` to maintain data integrity and positive behavior.  
4. **Plotted Histogram**: Visualized data distribution to observe trends in popularity.  
5. **Correlation Matrix Heatmap**: Created a heatmap to analyze relationships between features.  
6. **Individual Feature Impact Analysis**: Used scatter plots to understand the impact of specific features on the data.  
7. **Explicit Content Comparison**: Filtered and analyzed data where `Explicit = True`.  
8. **Statistical Modeling**: Conducted statistical modeling of music features for deeper insights.  

## Observations  
- Histogram analysis revealed distribution trends in music popularity.  
- Correlation heatmap identified significant relationships among features.  
- Scatter plots provided detailed insights into individual feature impacts.  
- Explicit content data comparison highlighted key differences in music characteristics.  

## Repository Highlights  
This repository provides Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for replicating the above tasks.  
Explore the code to see how data preprocessing, visualization, and statistical modeling can be seamlessly integrated into music data analysis workflows.
